Found no evidence of bias in subjective well-being indicators.\n-   **Significance:**\n    -   Provides insights into post-retirement mobilities, transnational lifestyles, and care configurations among older adults in transnational settings.\n\n## Limitation of using secondary datasets for studying older migrant population\n\nWhen studying older migrant populations using secondary data, there are several key limitations to be aware of. To address these limitations, researchers often need to complement secondary data analysis with **primary data collection, including qualitative studies**, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of older migrant populations.\n\n**Main challenges:**\n\n-   Methodological\n-   Ethical\n-   Data\n\n# Literature\n\n## Methodological Challenges\n\n#### 1. Defining the Population of Interest\n\n-   **Complexity:** Older migrants are a heterogeneous group, varying in age, origin, migration history, and legal status.\n-   **Migration Status:** Deciding whether to include second-generation immigrants, return migrants, or those with dual citizenship.\n-   **Cultural Considerations:** Definitions of \"older\" may differ across cultures and affect self-identification.\n\n## Methodological Challenges\n\n#### 2. Sampling Difficulties\n\n-   **Hard-to-Reach Populations:** Older migrants may be socially isolated or live in areas not easily accessible to researchers.\n-   **Language Barriers:** May limit participation in surveys or interviews.\n-   **Trust Issues:** Some migrants may be hesitant to participate due to fears related to their legal status or past experiences.\n-   **Representativeness:** Ensuring the sample accurately reflects the diversity within the older migrant population.\n-   **Sample Size:** Obtaining a large enough sample for statistical significance, especially for subgroups.\n\n## Methodological Challenges\n\n#### 3. Selection of Appropriate Questions\n\n-   **Cultural Sensitivity:** Ensuring questions are culturally appropriate and not offensive.\n-   **Relevance:** Developing questions that capture the unique experiences of older migrants.\n-   **Comparability:** Balancing the need for context-specific questions with the ability to compare across different migrant groups or with non-migrant populations.\n-   **Comprehension:** Ensuring questions are understood similarly across different linguistic and cultural groups.\n\n## Methodological Challenges\n\n#### 4. Ensuring Validity of Answers\n\n-   **Translation Issues:** Ensuring accurate translation of questions and responses across multiple languages.\n-   **Social Desirability Bias:** Respondents may answer in ways they think are socially acceptable rather than truthfully.\n-   **Recall Bias:** Older participants may have difficulty accurately remembering past events or experiences.\n-   **Proxy Responses:** When family members answer on behalf of older migrants, potentially introducing bias.\n-   **Cultural Interpretation:** Different cultures may interpret questions or concepts differently.\n\n## Methodological Challenges\n\n#### 5. Composition of the Research Team\n\n-   **Cultural Competence:** Ensuring researchers understand the cultural contexts of the populations they're studying.\n-   **Language Skills:** Having team members who speak the languages of the migrant groups being studied.\n-   **Interdisciplinary Approach:** Incorporating experts from various fields (e.g., gerontology, migration studies, public health) for a comprehensive perspective.\n-   **Diversity:** Including researchers from migrant backgrounds to bring insider perspectives and enhance trust with participants.\n-   **Training:** Providing specialized training for researchers on working with older migrant populations.\n\n## Ethical challenges\n\n#### 1. Obtaining informed consent:\n\n-   **Language barriers** may make it difficult to fully explain the research and obtain truly informed consent.\n-   **Cultural differences** in understanding concepts like research participation and consent.\n-   **Cognitive impairments** in some older participants may impact their ability to provide informed consent.\n\n## Ethical challenges\n\n#### 2. Discussing sensitive topics:\n\n-   **Migration experiences**, especially for refugees, may involve **trauma** that is difficult to discuss.\n-   **Cultural taboos** around certain topics (e.g. mental health, family relationships) may make participants **uncomfortable**.\n-   **Researchers need to balance gathering important data with respecting participants' boundaries**.\n\n## Ethical challenges\n\n#### 3. Addressing the impact of COVID-19:\n\n-   Older migrants are a **high-risk group**, requiring extra precautions for in-person research.\n-   Shift to **remote/online methods** may **exclude participants** without technology access/litteracy.\n-   Pandemic-related stressors may impact participants' wellbeing and **willingness to engage in research.**\n-   **Need to consider how the pandemic context affects research questions and data interpretation.**\n\n## Ethical challenges\n\n#### Additional ethical considerations:\n\n-   Ensuring **privacy and confidentiality**, especially for undocumented migrants.\n-   Providing appropriate **compensation** without being coercive.\n-   Addressing **power imbalances** between researchers and participants.\n-   Considering the **impact of the research** on the broader migrant community.\n-   **Ethical data sharing** practices, given the sensitive nature of the information.\n\n## Data Limitations in Older Migrant Research\n\n-   Lack of comprehensive **age-disaggregated data**\n-   Question adapted to the elderly population\n    -   Life course\n    -   Vulnerability\n    -   Integration\n    -   Mobility\n    -   Family\n    -   Transnationalism\n    -   Health\n    -   COVID-19\n\n# Selected criterias\n\n## Criterias for Datasets (1)\n\n**Categories:**\n\n-   **Where in the process?**\n    1.
