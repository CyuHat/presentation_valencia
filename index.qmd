## Introduction

Migration Studies

- Field continuously expanding with extensive data and advanced analytical methods.
- Focus predominantly on working-age migrants.

Gap in Research

- Elderly migrants are an underrepresented group in migration studies.
- Current research overlooks important dynamics specific to older age migration.

## Why eldery migrants?

Changing Dynamics in Retirement

- Increased life expectancies and advancements in technology and transportation.
- Greater opportunities for international mobility among retirees.

Implications of Mobility in Older Age

- Potential for more geographically dispersed family units.
- Enhanced global connectivity and extensive travel opportunities.
- Example: Retirees relocating internationally, such as from Switzerland.

## Goal

Compare three datasets from Switzerland:

1. Migration Mobility Survey (MMS)
2. Transnational Ageing Survey (TAS)
3. TransAge

Four topics:

1. Life course
2. Vulnerability
3. Integration
4. Mobility

## Why Switzerland?

### Switzerland offers an interesting context:

#### High proportion of the migrant population

## TransAge {.scrollable}

- **Dataset Overview: "Transnational Ageing Project: Post-Retirement Mobilities, Transnational Lifestyles and Care Configurations"**
  - **Focus:** Older adults (aged 65 and above) from four groups: Swiss natives, Italian international migrants in Switzerland, Italian stayers in Italy, and internally mobile Italians.

- **Data Collection and Study Design:**
  - **Research Institutes:** MIS Trend (Switzerland) and Demetra Opinioni (Italy).
  - **Collection Methods:** Online questionnaires, paper questionnaires, telephone interviews, and face-to-face interactions.
  - **Period:** June to November 2020, during the first and second COVID-19 waves.
  - **Participants:** Total of 2,354 older adults.
  - **Sampling Strategy:** 
    - Swiss sample stratified by age and gender.
    - Focused on six cantons (Zurich, Bern, Aargau, Vaud, Geneva, Ticino) hosting 70% of the Italian resident population in Switzerland.
    - Respondents offered a choice between online and paper questionnaires in German, Italian, and French.

- **Study Objectives and Context:**
  - **Aim:** Compare groups to understand dynamics due to significant older Italian population in Switzerland, many of whom migrated from Southern Italy between the 1950s and 1970s.
  - **Social Desirability Bias Test:** Compared Swiss Household Panel data (conducted by telephone) with data from paper/web methods for the Swiss sample. Found no evidence of bias in subjective well-being indicators.

- **Significance:**
  - Provides insights into post-retirement mobilities, transnational lifestyles, and care configurations among older adults in transnational settings.

## Limitation of using secondary datasets for studying older migrant population

When studying older migrant populations using secondary data, there are several key limitations to be aware of. To address these limitations, researchers often need to complement secondary data analysis with primary data collection, including qualitative studies, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of older migrant populations.

Main challenges:

- Methodological
- Ethical
- Data

## Methodological Challenges {.scrollable}

### 1. Defining the Population of Interest

- **Complexity:** Older migrants are a heterogeneous group, varying in age, origin, migration history, and legal status.
- **Age Threshold:** Determining what constitutes "older" can be challenging and may vary across cultures.
- **Migration Status:** Deciding whether to include second-generation immigrants, return migrants, or those with dual citizenship.
- **Cultural Considerations:** Definitions of "older" may differ across cultures and affect self-identification.

### 2. Sampling Difficulties

- **Hard-to-Reach Populations:** Older migrants may be socially isolated or live in areas not easily accessible to researchers.
- **Language Barriers:** May limit participation in surveys or interviews.
- **Trust Issues:** Some migrants may be hesitant to participate due to fears related to their legal status or past experiences.
- **Representativeness:** Ensuring the sample accurately reflects the diversity within the older migrant population.
- **Sample Size:** Obtaining a large enough sample for statistical significance, especially for subgroups.

### 3. Selection of Appropriate Questions

- **Cultural Sensitivity:** Ensuring questions are culturally appropriate and not offensive.
- **Relevance:** Developing questions that capture the unique experiences of older migrants.
- **Comparability:** Balancing the need for context-specific questions with the ability to compare across different migrant groups or with non-migrant populations.
- **Comprehension:** Ensuring questions are understood similarly across different linguistic and cultural groups.

### 4. Ensuring Validity of Answers

- **Translation Issues:** Ensuring accurate translation of questions and responses across multiple languages.
- **Social Desirability Bias:** Respondents may answer in ways they think are socially acceptable rather than truthfully.
- **Recall Bias:** Older participants may have difficulty accurately remembering past events or experiences.
- **Proxy Responses:** When family members answer on behalf of older migrants, potentially introducing bias.
- **Cultural Interpretation:** Different cultures may interpret questions or concepts differently.

### 5. Composition of the Research Team

- **Cultural Competence:** Ensuring researchers understand the cultural contexts of the populations they're studying.
- **Language Skills:** Having team members who speak the languages of the migrant groups being studied.
- **Interdisciplinary Approach:** Incorporating experts from various fields (e.g., gerontology, migration studies, public health) for a comprehensive perspective.
- **Diversity:** Including researchers from migrant backgrounds to bring insider perspectives and enhance trust with participants.
- **Training:** Providing specialized training for researchers on working with older migrant populations.

## Ethical challenges {.scrollable}

### 1. Obtaining informed consent:

- Language barriers may make it difficult to fully explain the research and obtain truly informed consent.
- Cultural differences in understanding concepts like research participation and consent.
- Cognitive impairments in some older participants may impact their ability to provide informed consent.

### 2. Discussing sensitive topics:

- Migration experiences, especially for refugees, may involve trauma that is difficult to discuss.
- Cultural taboos around certain topics (e.g. mental health, family relationships) may make participants uncomfortable.
- Researchers need to balance gathering important data with respecting participants' boundaries.

### 3. Addressing the impact of COVID-19:

- Older migrants are a high-risk group, requiring extra precautions for in-person research.
- Shift to remote/online methods may exclude participants without technology access.
- Pandemic-related stressors may impact participants' wellbeing and willingness to engage in research.
- Need to consider how the pandemic context affects research questions and data interpretation.

### Additional ethical considerations:

- Ensuring privacy and confidentiality, especially for undocumented migrants.
- Providing appropriate compensation without being coercive.
- Addressing power imbalances between researchers and participants.
- Considering the impact of the research on the broader migrant community.
- Ethical data sharing practices, given the sensitive nature of the information.

## Data Limitations in Older Migrant Research

### 1. Lack of Comprehensive Age-Disaggregated Data

### 2. Age specific question

## What have been done in the literatur {.scrollable}

1. Use of mixed-method designs: Combining quantitative and qualitative approaches to gain a more comprehensive understanding of older migrants' experiences.

2. Careful consideration of age thresholds: Many studies use 50 or 55 as the cutoff point for "older" migrants, recognizing that migrants may experience age-related issues earlier than non-migrants

3. Attention to migrant generation: Researchers are clarifying whether they include only first-generation migrants or also those who arrived as children (1.5 generation)

4. Collaborative approaches: There's a growing emphasis on collaboration between researchers, including data sharing and binding, to overcome limitations in individual studies.

5. Efforts to improve data collection: There's a push for more comprehensive and consistent age-disaggregated data collection across countries and regions.
