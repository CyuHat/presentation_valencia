#### Topic:

The possibilities and limitations for secondary analysis of existing large scale quantitative data sets for researching the aging-migration nexus

#### Title

Comparison of 3 datasets for the analysis of the elderly migrant population.

## Introduction

In this article, we are going to compare three datasets that can be used to explore the aging-migration nexus. We are going to highlight their advantages and their limitation in the analyis of the late stage of older migrants, particulary in four topics: life course, vulnerability, integration and mobility.

## Description of datasets

### Migration Mobility Survey (MMS)

The National Center of Competence in Research (NCCR) conducts the Migration and Mobility Survey (MMS) biennially to enhance the understanding of migration flows and the conditions of foreign residents in Switzerland (four wave at the moment). The survey aims to gather data to improve the reception and integration of immigrants, thereby contributing to Switzerland’s societal and economic development.

The MMS targets immigrants who were at least 18 years old upon immigration and between 24 to 64 years old at the time of the survey, excluding those under 18 as they typically do not migrate independently. The survey does not include holders of N (asylum seeker) or F (temporarily admitted) permits. During the second wave of the survey, respondents were between 26 to 70 years old.

To ensure comprehensive coverage and support detailed comparative analyses, the survey employed a stratified sampling technique. Strata were defined by gender and geopolitical criteria, creating 36 distinct groups. The target was to conduct approximately 190 interviews per stratum, aiming for a total of 6800 participants. The initial sample drawn was 11,053, based on a 33% anticipated participation rate. Additionally, the refresh sample aimed to address underrepresented nationalities and had an estimated response rate of 67%, with an additional 20% reserve sample drawn to ensure sufficient sample size.

The survey utilized mixed modes of data collection: 1% via Computer Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI) and 99% through Online Web Interviews (CAWI). The questionnaires for both methods were standardized and focused on collecting factual data, optimized through adaptations from the 2020 survey. These adaptations were reviewed in two internal workshops and various tests, including feedback from 10 Master’s students with migration backgrounds, to ensure clarity and neutrality in the questions. The comparison between the 2020 and 2022 questionnaires shows minimal changes, with only slight adaptations in the K module.

### Transnational Ageing Survey (TAS)

The retirement years are increasingly a time of change. Thanks to longer life expectancies and advancements in technology and transportation, retirees now have greater opportunities for international mobility, leading to more dispersed family units across different countries. This mobility allows retirees to stay more connected to the global community, travel extensively, or even relocate from Switzerland to other countries.

To gain deeper insights into this phenomenon, the NCCR – on the move has implemented the Transnational-Ageing Surveys. The initial survey was carried out in the first half of 2020 and provided crucial data for enhancing the quality of life for retirees spending part of their year in Switzerland. The survey invited both Swiss and foreign nationals aged 55 and older to participate.

The survey primarily focuses on the participants' lives in Switzerland, their past and current international movements, and their plans for retirement, either current or future. It also covers topics such as family setups in Switzerland and overseas, health, well-being, and overall living conditions.

To enhance insights into the new international mobility associated with retirees from Switzerland, two surveys focusing on transnational ageing were carried out with a national coverage of the resident population of Switzerland, all nationalities included, 55 years and older.

The initial Transnational Ageing Survey took place in the first half of 2020, gathering important information to enhance the quality of life for retirees who spend part of their year in Switzerland. The survey, which included both Swiss citizens and foreign nationals aged 55 and older, received responses from 3,772 participants and was coordinated by the opinion survey institute M.I.S Trend.

The subsequent Transnational Ageing Survey, a global initiative, commenced in November 2020 with collaboration from the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs and the Federal Office of Constructions and Logistics. This survey involved approximately 4,700 Swiss nationals aged 55 and older who reside overseas. Its purpose was to explore the living conditions of older adults in countries other than Switzerland.

Participants were mainly asked questions about their life in Switzerland, their past international mobility, their present travels to other countries and their future retirement plans. Other topics included family configuration in Switzerland and abroad, health and well-being and overall living conditions.

### TransAge

This dataset focus on older adults (aged 65 and above) from four populations: Swiss natives, Italian international migrants in Switzerland, and Italian stayers in Italy and internal mobile italians. The data for this study was collected through two research institutes: MIS Trend in Switzerland and Demetra Opinioni in Italy.

The study aimed to compare these groups due to the large number of older Italians in Switzerland, many of whom had migrated from Southern Italy between the 1950s and 1970s for economic reasons or to reunite with family members. Data was collected using various methods, including online questionnaires, paper questionnaires, telephone interviews, and face-to-face modes.

To test for social desirability bias in subjective well-being indicators, the study compared data from the Swiss Household Panel (which is conducted largely by telephone) to results from the exact same variables collected in the Swiss sample using paper/web methods. No evidence of a social desirability bias was found.

The data collection took place between June and November 2020, during the first and second waves of COVID-19 infections. In total, 2,354 older adults participated. The data was collected between June and November 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, between the first and the second wave of infections. For the data collection in Switzerland, a sample from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office was used. The sample is stratified by age and gender. Stratification by canton was not possible, therefore, the six cantons in which almost 70% of the total Italian resident population resides were chosen: Zurich, Bern, Aargau, Vaud, Geneva, and Ticino. The respondents were contacted by letter and had the choice between an online and a paper questionnaire, each one available in German, Italian, and French.

## Limitation of using secondary datasets for studying older migrant population

When studying older migrant populations using secondary data, there are several key limitations to be aware of. To address these limitations, researchers often need to complement secondary data analysis with primary data collection, including qualitative studies, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of older migrant populations.

The main challenges when conducting research on older migrants include defining the target population, sampling, question selection, validity of answers, and team composition. Ethical dilemmas arise in obtaining informed consent, discussing sensitive topics, and considering the impact of COVID-19. Researchers must be aware of these issues to design and conduct empirical studies involving older migrants effectively.

## Methodological Challenges in Studying Older Migrants

### 1. Defining the Population of Interest

### 2. Sampling Difficulties

### 3. Selection of Appropriate Questions

### 4. Ensuring Validity of Answers

### 5. Composition of the Research Team

### Strategies to Address These Challenges

1.  Use community-based participatory research approaches to involve older migrants in the research process.
2.  Employ mixed-method designs, combining quantitative and qualitative approaches for a more comprehensive understanding.
3.  Collaborate with community organizations to improve access and trust.
4.  Use culturally adapted research instruments and methods.
5.  Conduct pilot studies to test and refine research protocols.
6.  Employ advanced statistical techniques to address sampling biases and small sample sizes.

By carefully considering and addressing these methodological challenges, researchers can enhance the quality and validity of their studies on older migrants, leading to more reliable and actionable insights.

## Ethical challenges

### 1. Obtaining informed consent:

-   Language barriers may make it difficult to fully explain the research and obtain truly informed consent.
-   Cultural differences in understanding concepts like research participation and consent.
-   Cognitive impairments in some older participants may impact their ability to provide informed consent.

### 2. Discussing sensitive topics:

-   Migration experiences, especially for refugees, may involve trauma that is difficult to discuss.
-   Cultural taboos around certain topics (e.g. mental health, family relationships) may make participants uncomfortable.
-   Researchers need to balance gathering important data with respecting participants' boundaries.

### 3. Addressing the impact of COVID-19:

-   Older migrants are a high-risk group, requiring extra precautions for in-person research.
-   Shift to remote/online methods may exclude participants without technology access.
-   Pandemic-related stressors may impact participants' wellbeing and willingness to engage in research.
-   Need to consider how the pandemic context affects research questions and data interpretation.

### Additional ethical considerations mentioned in the sources:

-   Ensuring privacy and confidentiality, especially for undocumented migrants.
-   Providing appropriate compensation without being coercive.
-   Addressing power imbalances between researchers and participants.
-   Considering the impact of the research on the broader migrant community.
-   Ethical data sharing practices, given the sensitive nature of the information.

Researchers are encouraged to carefully consider these ethical challenges throughout the research process, from study design to dissemination of results. Engaging with the migrant community and seeking guidance from ethics boards can help navigate these complex issues.

## Data Limitations in Older Migrant Research

### 1. Incomplete Data for Certain Regions

-   Many countries in Africa, the Middle East, Caribbean, and Pacific have limited or no capacity to collect and disaggregate data by age [^30]:.
-   This results in millions of older persons being excluded from internationally comparable datasets [^31]:.
-   The lack of comprehensive data from these regions creates significant gaps in our understanding of global migration patterns among older populations.

### 2. Lack of Comprehensive Age-Disaggregated Data

-   While some age-disaggregated data exists, it's often not detailed enough for in-depth analysis of older migrant populations.
-   UN DESA provides data on migrants aged 65 or older, with subcategories of 65-69, 70-74, and 75+, but more granular age categories would be beneficial [^32]:.
-   The lack of detailed age data makes it challenging to understand the diverse needs and experiences of different age groups within the older migrant population.

### 3. Limited Information on Older Irregular Migrants

-   Data on older irregular migrants are generally not available [^33]:.
-   This gap in information makes it difficult to understand the unique challenges and vulnerabilities faced by this group.
-   The lack of data can lead to these individuals being overlooked in policy and support services.

### 4. Insufficient Research on South-South Migration and Social Costs

-   There is relatively little research on migration and aging in the context of south-south migration [^34]:.
-   The social costs for older persons left behind by migrants are not well understood or documented [^35]:.
-   This lack of research limits our understanding of the global impact of migration on older populations, particularly in developing countries.

### Additional Challenges

-   Data collection methods in shelters for internally displaced persons (IDPs) often fail to adequately capture age-specific information [^36]:.
-   The needs of older IDPs, which differ in terms of medical treatment, psycho-social support, and nutrition, are not well documented [^37]:.
-   There's limited information on the movement of internally displaced older persons from rural to urban settings [^38]:.

[^36]:
    -   **Cultural Competence:** Ensuring researchers understand the cultural contexts of the populations they're studying. - **Language Skills:** Having team members who speak the languages of the migrant groups being studied. - **Interdisciplinary Approach:** Incorporating experts from various fields (e.g., gerontology, migration studies, public health) for a comprehensive perspective. - **Diversity:** Including researchers from migrant backgrounds to bring insider perspectives and enhance trust with participants. - **Training:** Providing specialized training for researchers on working with older migrant populations.

To address these limitations, researchers and policymakers need to:

1.  Invest in improving data collection capacities in underrepresented regions.
2.  Develop more comprehensive and standardized methods for age-disaggregated data collection.
3.  Encourage more ethnographic studies to build an evidence base on older irregular migrants.
4.  Increase focus on south-south migration and its impacts on older populations.
5.  Improve data collection methods in IDP shelters to better capture age-specific information.

By addressing these data limitations, we can gain a more complete and nuanced understanding of older migrants' experiences and needs, leading to more effective policies and support systems.

## What have been done in the literatur

Based on the search results, several approaches have been taken to address the methodological challenges in studying older migrants:

1.  Increased reporting and reflection on fieldwork decisions: Researchers are providing more detailed accounts of how they tackled challenges and the implications of their methodological choices [^46]: [^47]:.

2.  Use of mixed-method designs: Combining quantitative and qualitative approaches to gain a more comprehensive understanding of older migrants' experiences [^48]: [^49]:.

3.  Adoption of community-based participatory research: Involving older migrants in the research process to improve relevance and cultural sensitivity [^50]: [^51]:.

4.  Careful consideration of age thresholds: Many studies use 50 or 55 as the cutoff point for "older" migrants, recognizing that migrants may experience age-related issues earlier than non-migrants [^52]: [^53]:.

5.  Attention to migrant generation: Researchers are clarifying whether they include only first-generation migrants or also those who arrived as children (1.5 generation) [^54]: [^55]:.

6.  Collaborative approaches: There's a growing emphasis on collaboration between researchers, including data sharing, to overcome limitations in individual studies [^56]: [^57]:.

7.  Ethnographic studies: Encouraged to build evidence on older irregular migrants, who are often excluded from official statistics [^58]:.

8.  Prioritizing migrant voices: Researchers are adopting methodologies that engage directly with older migrants, considering factors like age, gender, language, mobility, and disabilities [^59]:.

9.  Recognition of older migrants as research collaborators: Some studies are positioning older migrants as experts in understanding their own needs and challenges, rather than just as research subjects [^60]:.

10. Efforts to improve data collection: There's a push for more comprehensive and consistent age-disaggregated data collection across countries and regions [^61]:.

Despite these efforts, significant gaps remain. There's still limited primary empirical research specifically exploring the roles and contributions of older migrants in post-migration recovery [^62]:. Additionally, data on older irregular migrants and internally displaced older persons remain scarce [^63]:. The research community continues to call for more attention to these understudied areas and for improved data collection methods to better capture the diverse experiences of older migrants.

## Criteria for Datasets (1)

Categories: - When in the process? - Data planification - Data collection - Final datasets - Type of challenge? - Methodological - Ethical - Datasets

## Criteria for Datasets (2)

To conduct proper analysis of older migrants, datasets should ideally include:

-   Age disaggregation: Detailed age categories, especially for those 65 and older (e.g., 65-69, 70-74, 75+)
-   Demographic information: Sex, country of origin, duration of stay
-   Socioeconomic factors: Labor market outcomes, educational attainment
-   Health status: Physical and mental health indicators
-   Migration history: Type of migration (e.g., former guest workers, postcolonial migrants, refugees)
-   Destination country data: To facilitate cross-country comparisons
-   Longitudinal data: To allow for trend analysis over time
-   Qualitative data: To supplement quantitative information and provide context
-   Cultural and linguistic factors: To understand integration challenges
-   Access to services: Information on healthcare, social services, and support systems

Based on the challenges discussed earlier, here are the key criteria for a good dataset on older migrants:

1.  Comprehensive age disaggregation:
    -   Detailed age categories for those 65 and older (e.g., 65-69, 70-74, 75-79, 80-84, 85+)
    -   Consider using lower age thresholds (e.g., 50+) to account for earlier onset of age-related issues in migrant populations
2.  Wide geographic coverage:
    -   Include data from underrepresented regions like Africa, Middle East, Caribbean, and Pacific
    -   Capture both origin and destination country information
3.  Diverse migrant categories:
    -   Include data on regular and irregular migrants
    -   Cover different types of migration (e.g., labor migration, family reunification, refugee/asylum)
    -   Include information on internal displacement and south-south migration
4.  Longitudinal data:
    -   Track changes over time to understand integration processes and long-term outcomes
    -   Capture information on circular and return migration
5.  Multidimensional variables:
    -   Demographic information (age, sex, country of origin, duration of stay)
    -   Socioeconomic factors (education, income, employment status)
    -   Health status (physical and mental health indicators)
    -   Migration history and reasons for migration
    -   Language proficiency and cultural integration measures
    -   Access to and use of health and social services
6.  Qualitative data integration:
    -   Include or link to qualitative data to provide context and deeper insights
7.  Standardized definitions and measures:
    -   Use consistent definitions of "older migrants" across studies
    -   Employ standardized measures of key variables to allow for comparisons
8.  Ethical considerations:
    -   Ensure data collection methods protect privacy and confidentiality
    -   Include information on informed consent procedures
9.  Representation of vulnerable subgroups:
    -   Capture data on older irregular migrants and internally displaced older persons
    -   Include information on older migrants left behind by family members
10. Methodological transparency:
    -   Provide clear documentation of data collection methods, sampling strategies, and limitations
11. Accessibility and interoperability:
    -   Make data accessible to researchers while protecting privacy
    -   Ensure compatibility with other datasets for potential merging and comparative analysis
12. Regular updates:
    -   Implement systems for regular data collection and updates to capture changing trends

By meeting these criteria, a dataset would provide a more comprehensive and nuanced picture of older migrants, addressing many of the current limitations in the field and enabling more robust research and policy development.
