Comparaison de 3 jeux de données pour l'analyse de la population migrante agée.

## Introduction
In this article, we are going to compare three datasets that can be used to explore the aging-migration nexus. We are going to highlight their advantages and their limitation in the analyis of the late stage of older migrants, particulary in four topics: life course, vulnerability, integration and mobility.

	1. Migration Mobility Survey (MMS)
	2. Transnational Ageing Survey (TAS)
	3. Transnational Ageing Project (TAP)

## Description of datasets

### Migration Mobility Survey (MMS)

### Transnational Ageing Survey (TAS)

The retirement years are increasingly a time of change. Thanks to longer life expectancies and advancements in technology and transportation, retirees now have greater opportunities for international mobility, leading to more dispersed family units across different countries. This mobility allows retirees to stay more connected to the global community, travel extensively, or even relocate from Switzerland to other countries.

To gain deeper insights into this phenomenon, the NCCR – on the move has implemented the Transnational-Ageing Surveys. The initial survey was carried out in the first half of 2020 and provided crucial data for enhancing the quality of life for retirees spending part of their year in Switzerland. The survey invited both Swiss and foreign nationals aged 55 and older to participate.

The survey primarily focuses on the participants' lives in Switzerland, their past and current international movements, and their plans for retirement, either current or future. It also covers topics such as family setups in Switzerland and overseas, health, well-being, and overall living conditions.

To enhance insights into the new international mobility associated with retirees from Switzerland, two surveys focusing on transnational ageing were carried out with a national coverage of the resident population of Switzerland, all nationalities included, 55 years and older.

The initial Transnational Ageing Survey took place in the first half of 2020, gathering important information to enhance the quality of life for retirees who spend part of their year in Switzerland. The survey, which included both Swiss citizens and foreign nationals aged 55 and older, received responses from 3,772 participants and was coordinated by the opinion survey institute M.I.S Trend.

The subsequent Transnational Ageing Survey, a global initiative, commenced in November 2020 with collaboration from the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs and the Federal Office of Constructions and Logistics. This survey involved approximately 4,700 Swiss nationals aged 55 and older who reside overseas. Its purpose was to explore the living conditions of older adults in countries other than Switzerland.

Participants were mainly asked questions about their life in Switzerland, their past international mobility, their present travels to other countries and their future retirement plans. Other topics included family configuration in Switzerland and abroad, health and well-being and overall living conditions.

### Transnational Ageing Project (TAP)

Full name: "Transnational Ageing Project: Post-Retirement Mobilities, Transnational Lifestyles and Care Configurations"

This dataset focus on older adults (aged 65 and above) from four populations: Swiss natives, Italian international migrants in Switzerland, and Italian stayers in Italy and internal mobile italians. The data for this study was collected through two research institutes: MIS Trend in Switzerland and Demetra Opinioni in Italy.

The study aimed to compare these groups due to the large number of older Italians in Switzerland, many of whom had migrated from Southern Italy between the 1950s and 1970s for economic reasons or to reunite with family members. Data was collected using various methods, including online questionnaires, paper questionnaires, telephone interviews, and face-to-face modes.

To test for social desirability bias in subjective well-being indicators, the study compared data from the Swiss Household Panel (which is conducted largely by telephone) to results from the exact same variables collected in the Swiss sample using paper/web methods. No evidence of a social desirability bias was found.

The data collection took place between June and November 2020, during the first and second waves of COVID-19 infections. In total, 2,354 older adults participated. The data was collected between June and November 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, between the first and the second wave of infections. For the data collection in Switzerland, a sample from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office was used. The sample is stratified by age and gender. Stratification by canton was not possible, therefore, the six cantons in which almost 70% of the total Italian resident population resides were chosen: Zurich, Bern, Aargau, Vaud, Geneva, and Ticino. The respondents were contacted by letter and had the choice between an online and a paper questionnaire, each one available in German, Italian, and French.

## Limitation of using secondary datasets for studying older migrant population

When studying older migrant populations using secondary data, there are several key limitations to be aware of. To address these limitations, researchers often need to complement secondary data analysis with primary data collection, including qualitative studies, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of older migrant populations.

The main challenges when conducting research on older migrants include defining the target population, sampling, question selection, validity of answers, and team composition. Ethical dilemmas arise in obtaining informed consent, discussing sensitive topics, and considering the impact of COVID-19. Researchers must be aware of these issues to design and conduct empirical studies involving older migrants effectively.

You've identified key methodological challenges in studying older migrants. Let's explore each of these challenges in more detail:

## Methodological Challenges in Studying Older Migrants

### 1. Defining the Population of Interest
[1]
- **Complexity:** Older migrants are a heterogeneous group, varying in age, origin, migration history, and legal status.
- **Age Threshold:** Determining what constitutes "older" can be challenging and may vary across cultures.
- **Migration Status:** Deciding whether to include second-generation immigrants, return migrants, or those with dual citizenship.
- **Cultural Considerations:** Definitions of "older" may differ across cultures and affect self-identification.

### 2. Sampling Difficulties
[1]
- **Hard-to-Reach Populations:** Older migrants may be socially isolated or live in areas not easily accessible to researchers.
- **Language Barriers:** May limit participation in surveys or interviews.
- **Trust Issues:** Some migrants may be hesitant to participate due to fears related to their legal status or past experiences.
- **Representativeness:** Ensuring the sample accurately reflects the diversity within the older migrant population.
- **Sample Size:** Obtaining a large enough sample for statistical significance, especially for subgroups.

### 3. Selection of Appropriate Questions
[1]
- **Cultural Sensitivity:** Ensuring questions are culturally appropriate and not offensive.
- **Relevance:** Developing questions that capture the unique experiences of older migrants.
- **Comparability:** Balancing the need for context-specific questions with the ability to compare across different migrant groups or with non-migrant populations.
- **Comprehension:** Ensuring questions are understood similarly across different linguistic and cultural groups.

### 4. Ensuring Validity of Answers
[1]
- **Translation Issues:** Ensuring accurate translation of questions and responses across multiple languages.
- **Social Desirability Bias:** Respondents may answer in ways they think are socially acceptable rather than truthfully.
- **Recall Bias:** Older participants may have difficulty accurately remembering past events or experiences.
- **Proxy Responses:** When family members answer on behalf of older migrants, potentially introducing bias.
- **Cultural Interpretation:** Different cultures may interpret questions or concepts differently.

### 5. Composition of the Research Team
[1]
- **Cultural Competence:** Ensuring researchers understand the cultural contexts of the populations they're studying.
- **Language Skills:** Having team members who speak the languages of the migrant groups being studied.
- **Interdisciplinary Approach:** Incorporating experts from various fields (e.g., gerontology, migration studies, public health) for a comprehensive perspective.
- **Diversity:** Including researchers from migrant backgrounds to bring insider perspectives and enhance trust with participants.
- **Training:** Providing specialized training for researchers on working with older migrant populations.

### Strategies to Address These Challenges

1. Use community-based participatory research approaches to involve older migrants in the research process.
2. Employ mixed-method designs, combining quantitative and qualitative approaches for a more comprehensive understanding.
3. Collaborate with community organizations to improve access and trust.
4. Use culturally adapted research instruments and methods.
5. Conduct pilot studies to test and refine research protocols.
6. Employ advanced statistical techniques to address sampling biases and small sample sizes.

By carefully considering and addressing these methodological challenges, researchers can enhance the quality and validity of their studies on older migrants, leading to more reliable and actionable insights.

## Ethical challenges

### 1. Obtaining informed consent:
- Language barriers may make it difficult to fully explain the research and obtain truly informed consent.
- Cultural differences in understanding concepts like research participation and consent.
- Cognitive impairments in some older participants may impact their ability to provide informed consent.

### 2. Discussing sensitive topics:
- Migration experiences, especially for refugees, may involve trauma that is difficult to discuss.
- Cultural taboos around certain topics (e.g. mental health, family relationships) may make participants uncomfortable.
- Researchers need to balance gathering important data with respecting participants' boundaries.

### 3. Addressing the impact of COVID-19:
- Older migrants are a high-risk group, requiring extra precautions for in-person research.
- Shift to remote/online methods may exclude participants without technology access.
- Pandemic-related stressors may impact participants' wellbeing and willingness to engage in research.
- Need to consider how the pandemic context affects research questions and data interpretation.

### Additional ethical considerations mentioned in the sources:
- Ensuring privacy and confidentiality, especially for undocumented migrants.
- Providing appropriate compensation without being coercive.
- Addressing power imbalances between researchers and participants.
- Considering the impact of the research on the broader migrant community.
- Ethical data sharing practices, given the sensitive nature of the information.

Researchers are encouraged to carefully consider these ethical challenges throughout the research process, from study design to dissemination of results. Engaging with the migrant community and seeking guidance from ethics boards can help navigate these complex issues.

## Data Limitations in Older Migrant Research

### 1. Incomplete Data for Certain Regions

- Many countries in Africa, the Middle East, Caribbean, and Pacific have limited or no capacity to collect and disaggregate data by age[1].
- This results in millions of older persons being excluded from internationally comparable datasets[1].
- The lack of comprehensive data from these regions creates significant gaps in our understanding of global migration patterns among older populations.

### 2. Lack of Comprehensive Age-Disaggregated Data

- While some age-disaggregated data exists, it's often not detailed enough for in-depth analysis of older migrant populations.
- UN DESA provides data on migrants aged 65 or older, with subcategories of 65-69, 70-74, and 75+, but more granular age categories would be beneficial[1].
- The lack of detailed age data makes it challenging to understand the diverse needs and experiences of different age groups within the older migrant population.

### 3. Limited Information on Older Irregular Migrants

- Data on older irregular migrants are generally not available[1].
- This gap in information makes it difficult to understand the unique challenges and vulnerabilities faced by this group.
- The lack of data can lead to these individuals being overlooked in policy and support services.

### 4. Insufficient Research on South-South Migration and Social Costs

- There is relatively little research on migration and aging in the context of south-south migration[1].
- The social costs for older persons left behind by migrants are not well understood or documented[1].
- This lack of research limits our understanding of the global impact of migration on older populations, particularly in developing countries.

### Additional Challenges

- Data collection methods in shelters for internally displaced persons (IDPs) often fail to adequately capture age-specific information[1].
- The needs of older IDPs, which differ in terms of medical treatment, psycho-social support, and nutrition, are not well documented[1].
- There's limited information on the movement of internally displaced older persons from rural to urban settings[1].

To address these limitations, researchers and policymakers need to:

1. Invest in improving data collection capacities in underrepresented regions.
2. Develop more comprehensive and standardized methods for age-disaggregated data collection.
3. Encourage more ethnographic studies to build an evidence base on older irregular migrants.
4. Increase focus on south-south migration and its impacts on older populations.
5. Improve data collection methods in IDP shelters to better capture age-specific information.

By addressing these data limitations, we can gain a more complete and nuanced understanding of older migrants' experiences and needs, leading to more effective policies and support systems.

## What have been done in the literatur

Based on the search results, several approaches have been taken to address the methodological challenges in studying older migrants:

1. Increased reporting and reflection on fieldwork decisions: Researchers are providing more detailed accounts of how they tackled challenges and the implications of their methodological choices[1][2].

2. Use of mixed-method designs: Combining quantitative and qualitative approaches to gain a more comprehensive understanding of older migrants' experiences[1][2].

3. Adoption of community-based participatory research: Involving older migrants in the research process to improve relevance and cultural sensitivity[1][2].

4. Careful consideration of age thresholds: Many studies use 50 or 55 as the cutoff point for "older" migrants, recognizing that migrants may experience age-related issues earlier than non-migrants[1][2].

5. Attention to migrant generation: Researchers are clarifying whether they include only first-generation migrants or also those who arrived as children (1.5 generation)[1][2].

6. Collaborative approaches: There's a growing emphasis on collaboration between researchers, including data sharing, to overcome limitations in individual studies[1][2].

7. Ethnographic studies: Encouraged to build evidence on older irregular migrants, who are often excluded from official statistics[4].

8. Prioritizing migrant voices: Researchers are adopting methodologies that engage directly with older migrants, considering factors like age, gender, language, mobility, and disabilities[3].

9. Recognition of older migrants as research collaborators: Some studies are positioning older migrants as experts in understanding their own needs and challenges, rather than just as research subjects[3].

10. Efforts to improve data collection: There's a push for more comprehensive and consistent age-disaggregated data collection across countries and regions[4].

Despite these efforts, significant gaps remain. There's still limited primary empirical research specifically exploring the roles and contributions of older migrants in post-migration recovery[3]. Additionally, data on older irregular migrants and internally displaced older persons remain scarce[4]. The research community continues to call for more attention to these understudied areas and for improved data collection methods to better capture the diverse experiences of older migrants.
